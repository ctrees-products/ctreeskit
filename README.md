## Features

- Spatial processing with xarray DataArrays
- Area calculations and geometry data
- Arraylake Ingestion tools 

A Python module for efficient geospatial operations on raster data using xarray, with support for integrating vector geometries and calculating areas.

## API Reference

# XrSpatialProcessor
[Xr Spatial Processor ReadMe](./docs/xr_analyzer.md#xr_spatial_processor_module)

This module provides tools to:

- Process geospatial vector data (from files or objects) into standardized geometry containers
- Clip rasters to geometries or bounding boxes
- Align and resample rasters to match reference grids
- Calculate accurate cell areas for geographic rasters
- Create weighted masks based on geometry-pixel intersections

# XrZonalStats
[Xr Zonal Stats ReadMe](./docs/xr_analyzer.md#xr_zonal_stats_module)

This module provides tools to:

- Calculate area statistics for different classes in categorical rasters
- Calculate area statistics for a combination of two categorical rasters combined
- Support both time-series and static (non-temporal) raster data
- Offer flexible area calculation options (pixel counts, constant values, or spatially-variable areas)
- Generate tabular summaries as pandas DataFrames

# ArraylakeTools
[Arraylake Tools ReadMe](./docs/arraylake_tools.md)

This module provides tools to:

- Calculate area statistics for different classes in categorical rasters
- Support both time-series and static (non-temporal) raster data
- Offer flexible area calculation options (pixel counts, constant values, or spatially-variable areas)
- Generate tabular summaries as pandas DataFrames
